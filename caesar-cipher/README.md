# Caesar Cipher

Caesar Cipher is an encryption technique that replaces every letter in plaintext with a letter in some fixed numbers of positions down the alphabet.

## What to do

Define a method called **caeser_cipher** that accepts a **string** and a **number**. the method replaces every letter in the **string** with a letter positioned down by **number**.

```ruby
> caesar_cipher("What a string!", 5)
=> "Bmfy xywnsl!"
```

## Lessons Learned

* Loop through an array
* Use predicate enumerable methods
* Convert string to array and array to string
* How conditionals are useful for the efficiency

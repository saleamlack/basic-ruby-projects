# Bubble Sort

**Bubble Sort** is a way of sorting a group of items in an array where each element is compared to the one next to it and they are swapped if the one on the left is larger than the one on the right. This continues until the array is eventually sorted.

## What to do

Define a method `bubble_sort` that takes an `array`, sort items using **bubble sort** methodology and return the sorted array.

```ruby
> bubble_sort([4,3,78,2,0,2])
=> [0,2,2,3,4,78]
```

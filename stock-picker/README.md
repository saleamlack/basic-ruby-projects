## Stock Picker

**Stock Picker** is used to determine the best pair of days to buy and sell.

## What to do

Define a method called **stock_picker** that takes in an **array** of stock prices and return the best pair of days to buy and to sell. It is needed to buy before sell.

```ruby
> stock_picker([17,3,6,9,15,8,6,1,10])
=> [1,4]  # for a profit of $15 - $3 == $12
```

## Learned Lessons
* Work with an **Array**
* Work with Conditionals
